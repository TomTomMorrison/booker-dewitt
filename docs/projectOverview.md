### What is the application?
It is a location based booking system for nurseries.\
Nurseries can flag open slots on their calendar for parents to request to book.

### Why create this application?
The average cost of nursery in N.I is Â£169 p/week.\
The standard is to book for a duration of time, commonly a year.\
This leads to occasions when children are booked in to nursery but cannot attend, leaving empty spaces.\
Parents who require urgent or irregular daycare facilities then struggle to find availability.

### How will the application work?
Guest users can see registered nurseries in their area and their availability but cannot place booking requests.\

#### To create a profile a user must include:
  - Name
  - Address
  - Email
  - Contact Number
  - Children

#### To add children a user must include:
  - Name
  - DOB (Must be older than 1 and younger than 4)

#### To register on the application a nursery must include:
  - Name
  - Address
  - Email
  - Contact Number

#### MVP:
  - A user (Guardian / Nursery) can create an account & login.
  - A user (Nursery) can add available dates.
  - A user (Guardian) can place a booking request for an available date.

#### Stretch Goals:
  - A user (Nursery) can accept a booking request for an available date.
  - A user (Guardian) can complete payment for an accepted booking request.
  - A user (Guardian) can add preferences and receive notifications for selected Nurseries.

Users can add notifications for when certain nurseries have availability for selected dates.
