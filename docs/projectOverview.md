### What is the application?
It is a location based booking system for nurseries.\
Nurseries can flag open slots on their calendar for parents to book and pay for.

### Why create this application?
The average cost of nursery in N.I is Â£169 p/week.\
The standard is to book for a duration of time, commonly a year.\
This leads to occasions when children are booked in to nursery but cannot attend, leaving empty spaces.\
Parents who require urgent or irregular daycare facilities then struggle to find availability.

### How will the application work?
Guest users can see registered nurseries in their area and their availability but cannot place bookings.\
